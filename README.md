# Gas-Leak-Smoke-Detection-ESP32
This repository contains a project for a gas leak detection system and smoke/fire alarm using ESP32 and integrated with the Blynk IoT platform. The system is designed to detect hazardous gas leaks (e.g., LPG, methane) or smoke and send real-time alerts to the user through Blynk's mobile app.
